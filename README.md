👋 Hi, I’m @IlyaShestov

👨‍💻About me:
I have been working with a large amount of data for many years - I was engaged in the purchase of pharmaceuticals from distribution companies. 
In the process, I used linear models in data analysis and production planning, which motivated me to study machine learning more deeply. 
For me ML is a unique field that combines forecasting and automation - those things that give me pleasure in my work

Now I am looking for an interesting job in ML

💻My hard skills:
-I use Python (Pandas, NumPy, SKlearn, Scipy, FastAPI) to analyze data and train models. 
-I know the basic classical approaches to solving regression, classification and clustering problems, and also used libraries with advanced models: CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM.
-Familiar with the PyTorch library and the device of neural networks. I can write a simple neural network or train a ready-made one for my data. 
-I know SQL syntax and can write simple queries. I use Git for code versioning and am familiar with AirFlow for process automation.
-I know how to conduct A/B tests and use statistical criteria to evaluate them

🤝My soft skills:
-I am able and not afraid to take on what seems new and difficult.
-I know how to communicate with people and build processes together from scratch.
-I love analyzing, optimizing and automating.
